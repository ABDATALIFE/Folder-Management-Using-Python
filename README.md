# Folder-Management-Using-Python

This project was built on Python(Using the SPYDER IDE). This project goes through the directory and all of its subfolders to provide
a visual representation of the space occupied by the different folders. The visual representation is a stacked bar-graph just like Iphone's
storage representation. The division goes upto two levels , Folders and Subfolders.
